# Chicolatl
This project was created based on an idea I had in university to create a subscription-based chocolate company designed for the Japanese market. It would bring chocolate from around the world to allow people to enjoy to taste of the world.

## Set-Up
I'm using mostly HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. I've currently got all the information in a JSON file and am using ES6 and local storage to retain the values.

## Next-Up
Here are a couple of things I'd like to add:
- Japanese language option
- A true check-out section
- Themes for a group
- A nav menu that mimicks the check-out cart
- More sections like an about, blog, etc.
